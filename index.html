        Gender Pay Gap
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What Is the Gender Pay Gap?
It’s not just about men and women doing different jobs.

It often exists even when they do the same job with the same qualifications.

It’s usually expressed as a percentage:

Example: If women earn 90 cents for every dollar a man earns, the pay gap is 10%.
