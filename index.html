        Gender Pay Gap
    </h2>

            What Is the Gender Pay Gap?
It’s not just about men and women doing different jobs.

It often exists even when they do the same job with the same qualifications.

It’s usually expressed as a percentage:

Example: If women earn 90 cents for every dollar a man earns, the pay gap is 10%.

                <p class="notable-women-description">
                Grace Brewster Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy rear admiral.
                [1] She was a pioneer of computer programming. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and used this theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC programming language and COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. 
                She was also one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I computer. She is credited with writing the first computer manual, "A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator."
